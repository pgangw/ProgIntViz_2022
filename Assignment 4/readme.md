# Assignment 4

This visualization was created as part of a classroom assignment. The goal of the assignment was to learn creating accessible visuals using D3. 

## Data Source

The data on NYC unemployment rates were downloaded from [Statista](https://www-statista-com.ezproxy.pratt.edu/statistics/190697/unemployment-rate-in-new-york-since-1992/).

## Visual Findings

The visual shows that the unemployment rate was at its peak in the year of the covid pandemic, in 2020. It was consistently high post the recession period lasting in 2009. The uemployment rate was the lowest in 2019 among the others.

## Incorporating Accessibility in the Visual

The following elements were used to improve the accessibility of the visualization:

- The colors are colorblind safe. The pallete was chosen from [Color Brewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3). The palette ensures not using the "stop light" color palette whilst maintaining adequate contrast of 8.59:1.
- The visual is described using plain language. The definition of unemployment rate, the data source, color descriptions and key inferences have been mentioned in the visualization. 
- The alt text of the visualization is mentioned in detail. 
- The visual makes use of not just colors, but also a svg pattern for easily understanding.
- The visual was tested using Chrome's accessibility checking extension - Wave Evaluation Tool.
