# Assignment 5

The following inforgaphic shows the annual salary required to buy homes in some of the United States' metropolitans cities. The goal of this project was to update a visual created earlier and learn to design interactions using D3.

## Data source

The dataset for this project is sourced from [this link](https://www-statista-com.ezproxy.pratt.edu/statistics/1235757/salary-needed-to-buy-median-priced-home-usa-by-metro/) on Statista.

## Description of the visual

The infographic shows that San jose and San Francisco were some of the most expensive cities in terms of the salaries required to buy homes. Cleveland, Birmingham and Oklahoma among a few more, were some of the only cities that required salaries under $50,000.

## Interaction updates added to the visual

### Screenshots of the updated visual 

I created two variations of the visual. The first one explores sorting using single and double clicks. And the next explores sorting using a button. 

1. ***Sorting using single and double clicks (homeprices_clickfeature.html)***

Tooltip:
While the inital visual shows the city and salary details using a text label below every house illustartion, the updated version displays them using a tooltip. Note, the tooltip is styled to match with the style of the rest of the visual.

Sorting in ascending order:
The visual sorts the data in ascending order on a single click

Sorting in descending order:
The visual sorts the data in descending order on double clicks

2. ***Sorting using a button (homeprices_buttonfeature.html)***

Tooltip:
The styling of the tooltip is the same as described in the previous section.

Sorting in descending order:
The visual sorts the data in descending order on clicking the button. Note, the button is placed in the center of ther visual for easy accessibility.
