# Assignment 7

This visualization was created as part of a classroom assignment. The goal of the assignment is to learn creating **network charts** using D3. 

## Data source

The data on US airports and the frequency of flights between them were downloaded from [Kateto.net](https://kateto.net/polnet2018). The dataset is used for classroom purposes only. 

***The dataset is not uploaded in this repository to prevent it from being downloaded from here.*** 

## Visual findings

It can be seen that the Seattle, Detroit, Newark and Houston aiport are some of the most busy airports in terms of domestic connectivity. 

## Features added to the graph 

1. Single color nodes
2. Arrowheads
3. Interactive element - drag feature
4. Label names
5. Use of force simulation

## Further scope for improvement

I'd like to work towards making the arrowheads of the lighter edges visibile as they're currently hidden under the nodes.
