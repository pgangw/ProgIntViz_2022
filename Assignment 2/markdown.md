# Week 3 Assignment 

## Plotting a bar chart using D3

### Data source

Data for this assignment was gathered from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/80-cereals). The dataset provided values of sugar content and calories for the different cereals. The values shown on the visual have been ***dervied*** from the data types in the dataset.  

### Explanation of the visual

The visual represents the percentage of sugar in total calories of different cereals. It can be seen that Golden crisps, Apple jack and Smacks have the highest ampunt of sugar in the calories, while wheat and rice based cereals do not have any sugar. 

The X-axis shows the name of the cereal while the Y-axis represents the percentage of sugar. 

Below is a screenshot of the visual:
